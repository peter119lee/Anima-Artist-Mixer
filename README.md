# Anima-Artist-Mixer

A ComfyUI custom node that enables **multi-artist mixing** for the Anima model by hooking into its cross-attention layers.

![surtr](docs/images/ComfyUI_01092_.png)
## What it does

Anima uses an LLM as its text encoder. When multiple artist tags are stacked in a single prompt, the LLM's contextualization causes them to interfere with each other, producing a conditioning that resembles neither artist clearly. This node encodes each artist independently and mixes them at the model's cross-attention layer, sidestepping the interference at the prompt-encoding stage.

The bundled `AnimaArtistPack` node provides a one-shot experience: write your artist list (separated by commas or newlines) in one text box, your main prompt in another, and the node handles splitting, encoding, and packaging automatically.

Product principle: the default path is predictable artist mixing on top of the base model. It should preserve the prompt and expose artist influence in a controllable way; automatic low-drift routing and stabilizers are opt-in tools, not the default style source.

The current release (v26) adds negative artist weights (style subtraction), smoothstep timing fades (`%0.0-0.45~0.1`), optional style-drift reduction via token-level base-energy norm locking (`match_base_norm`, `norm_lock_mode`, `norm_lock_scope`), the content-safer `stable_seed` static-capture preset, prompt-aware `drift_auto` routing plus scene-tuned low-drift presets (`drift_soft`, `face_lock`, `scene_lock`), a stronger legacy `anchor_lock` preset, a per-layer style probe that measures where each artist actually lives in the model, shareable JSON recipes, VRAM controls (`max_batch_artists`, `low_vram_cache`), a CFG correctness fix for batch sizes > 1, and a full package restructure with tests and CI. Earlier releases added one-click presets, UX helper nodes, an in-UI inspector, deterministic low-rank mixing, layered cross-seed stabilizers, CFG-style strength extrapolation, the linear injection-layer weight syntax `::name::weight`, per-artist layer/timing routing, and a compatibility-safe preset.

## Installation

Clone or download into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory:

```
ComfyUI/custom_nodes/<this-plugin-folder>/
```

Restart ComfyUI. No extra dependencies.

## Requirements

- **Anima model only** — depends on Anima's built-in `LLMAdapter` (`preprocess_text_embeds`)
- Use the **same CLIP loader** that Anima's own text-encoding workflow uses (the one whose tokens carry `t5xxl_ids`)
- Inference only

## Quick start
![workflow](docs/images/workflow.png)

Open [`workflow/Shift testing.before-basic-simplify.json`](<workflow/Shift testing.before-basic-simplify.json>)
for a complete importable example. It keeps the real generation/output chain
and shows the recommended `AnimaArtistPreset(preset = balanced)` wiring
without requiring users to build the workflow from scratch.

- Top text box of `AnimaArtistPack`: your artist chain (comma or newline separated)
- Fastest first run: use `AnimaArtistStarter`, fill `artist_table`, then follow its in-UI guide
- Use `AnimaArtistChainBuilder` when you do not want to hand-write `::weight`, `@layers`, and `%timing`
- Builder's three visible rows are only shortcuts; use its `artist_table` field for larger chains
- Use `AnimaArtistChainPreview` to validate a chain before paying the CLIP encoding cost
- Bottom text box: the main prompt (no need to repeat artist names here)
- Wire `AnimaArtistCrossAttn`'s `base_prompt` output directly to KSampler's positive input
- For a sane first run, connect `AnimaArtistPreset` with `preset = balanced`
- For common layer/timing tweaks, use `AnimaArtistSimpleOptions`; keep `AnimaArtistOptions (Expert)` for stabilizer A/B and debugging
- If the workflow also uses regional prompting, Forge Couple-style routing, or other attention patchers, start with `preset = compatibility_safe`
- When a workflow behaves strangely, connect `AnimaArtistInspector` and read the effective weights / warnings directly in ComfyUI

For full parameter explanations and recommended combinations, see [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).

## Recommended defaults

For most users, start with:

```
AnimaArtistStarter:
recipe    = balanced
layout    = layer_scheduled

or:

AnimaArtistPreset:
preset    = balanced
intensity = 1.0
```

Manual equivalent:

```
combine_mode = output_avg
fusion_mode  = interpolate
strength     = 1.0
artist_ema_alpha = 0.0
match_base_norm  = False
```

To weight individual artists within the chain, use either of two syntaxes (they can coexist and stack):

```
wlop, ::sakimichan::1.2, (krenz:0.7), ::pixiv_style::-0.4
```

- `(name:1.2)` — CLIP-side weighting (same as SD/A1111), non-linear, applied at text encoding
- `::name::1.2` — injection-side weighting (v24+), linear and predictable, applied at cross-attention output
- `::name::-0.4` — **negative weight (v26+)**: subtracts that artist's style direction instead of adding it (style subtraction); range is [-4, 4]
- In v25+, any valid `::weight` automatically disables normalization at runtime so explicit weights stay absolute
- Per-artist layer routing is supported with `@layers`: `wlop@0-8, krenz@9-18, hiten@19-27`
- Per-artist sampling timing is supported with `%start-end`: `wlop@0-8%0.0-0.45, krenz@9-18%0.45-0.85`
- Timing windows can fade in/out smoothly with `~fade` (v26+): `wlop%0.0-0.45~0.1` ramps the artist's weight with a smoothstep over a 0.1-progress-wide edge instead of switching on/off abruptly
- Anima artist tags that start with `@` are safe: `@wlop` remains the artist name; only a final numeric suffix like `@0-8` is treated as layer routing

## Compatibility notes

This node wraps Anima cross-attention. Other nodes that also patch attention, regional prompts, Forge Couple-style routing, or model forward wrappers can change the same execution path. If the artist effect disappears or becomes very weak, use `AnimaArtistPreset(preset = compatibility_safe)` first. It forces the tolerant `concat + concat_with_base` path and disables cache-heavy stabilizers. Use `AnimaArtistInspector` to confirm parsed artists, weights, layer routes, timing routes, block map, and effective normalize state.

## Cross-seed stability

In multi-artist setups, the same prompt with different seeds tends to produce noticeably different style mixes — sometimes one artist dominates, other times another, even at equal weights. This is structural to how cross-attention interacts with seed-driven hidden state.

v26 keeps `balanced` close to the original mixer behavior by default. Common layer/timing controls live in `AnimaArtistSimpleOptions`; optional stabilizers live in `AnimaArtistOptions (Expert)`, ordered from light to heavy:

| Stabilizer | Strength | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `match_base_norm` + `norm_lock_mode=token` + `norm_lock_scope=per_artist` | optional | Per-artist token RMS lock; reduces seed-specific style-strength spikes before artists are mixed |
| `artist_ema_alpha` | light | Temporal EMA across sampling steps |
| `combine_mode = lowrank_avg` + `lowrank_k` | medium | Deterministic low-rank constraint on multi-artist deltas |
| `artist_static_capture` + `static_capture_k` | heavy | Freeze artist attention after K warmup steps; `stable_seed` uses K=4 with auto layers 9-20 and norm lock disabled. Advanced `static_capture_mode` values include `output`, `delta`, `blend`, and `blend_perp`; `output` remains the measured default. |
| `contribution_balance` | optional | Delta-strength equalizer for artist dominance flips; default off because static capture was more reliable in live A/B |
| `mixed_delta_cap` | optional | Caps the final mixed artist delta against base attention energy before fusion; default off while it is evaluated as a live A/B candidate |
| `artist_anchor_q` | heaviest | Replace user-seed Q with a fixed-seed anchor's Q; `anchor_lock` keeps the legacy 4-anchor path with auto layers 9-25 and user-Q handoff at L16 |
| `anchor_base_norm_ref` | optional | Anchor the norm reference too when testing `anchor_q + match_base_norm`; useful for A/B, not the measured default |

Recommended progression: start with `balanced` for original-style behavior, then use `stable_seed` or `drift_auto` for content-safer cross-seed work. For lower drift, `drift_auto` routes 4+ artist wide / background-heavy scenes to `face_lock`, smaller explicit wide / background-heavy scenes to `scene_lock`, 4+ artist simple fullbody prompts to `drift_soft`, 4+ artist close-ups to `stable_seed` plus `mixed_delta_cap_ratio=0.75`, 4+ artist street / urban prompts to `compatibility_safe`, other 4+ artist portrait / broad-subject prompts to the internal `compatibility_safe_9_15` route, smaller close-up face prompts to `face_lock`, and the remaining portrait / broad-subject and plain street/fullbody prompts to `drift_soft` from the `base_prompt` and artist count. If a known artist set still shows large seed-to-seed swings, A/B `match_base_norm` or `mixed_delta_cap` at ratios around `0.75-1.0` before changing presets globally. Use the manual variants when you already know the prompt type, and use `anchor_lock` only when you explicitly want the stronger anchor-Q lock. See [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md) for detailed mechanics and tuning.

## Style amplification

`strength` accepts values in `[0, 4]`:

- `0 ~ 1` — interpolation between base and artist (`strength=1` = pure artist replacement)
- `1 ~ 4` — CFG-style extrapolation: `out = base + strength * (artist - base)`, amplifying the artist's deviation from base for stronger style

`1.5 ~ 2.5` is a common range for "stronger style without breaking content"; pushing past `3` tends to oversaturate.

## Performance notes

Generation time scales with artist count. Per the math of `output_avg`, each layer runs `N + 1` cross-attention forwards (N artists + base). Approximate measured cost (varies by GPU):

| Configuration | Relative time |
|---|---|
| 1 artist | 1.0x |
| 4 artists | ~1.4x |
| 8 artists | ~1.7x |
| 5 artists + `artist_static_capture` (K=6) | ~1.1x |
| 5 artists + `artist_anchor_q` (cached) | ~1.05x |

**Strongly recommended**: connect `AnimaArtistSimpleOptions` and limit either the layer shortcut or the sampling-step range. Both can dramatically reduce generation time with minimal quality loss. With many artists at high resolution, use `AnimaArtistOptions (Expert)` only when you need VRAM caps, cache offload, or stabilizer A/B. See the docs for details.

## Measuring where styles live (v26)

Instead of guessing `@layers` routes, wire `AnimaArtistProbe` between your model loader and the sampler, run one generation, and read `AnimaArtistProbeReport` (connect any post-sampler output as its trigger). The report shows each artist's per-layer style influence (`||artist_out − base_out|| / ||base_out||`) as a bar chart and suggests a concrete `artist@lo-hi` route per artist. The probe pass does not alter the generated image.

## Sharing recipes (v26)

`AnimaArtistRecipeSave` packs the artist chain plus the full effective configuration (combine/fusion/strength/advanced options) into one JSON string; `AnimaArtistRecipeLoad` turns it back into `artist_chain` + a `preset` payload you can wire straight into `AnimaArtistCrossAttn`. Paste-friendly for sharing exact mixes with other users.

## Important caveat

This node **cannot achieve the near-lossless artist mixing that SDXL does**. Anima's text encoder is non-linear, so any mixing strategy introduces some distortion. What this node does is make that distortion controllable. Style-similar artists mix well; style-divergent artists may "regress to the mean" into a compromise look — `lowrank_avg` accepts more of this regression in exchange for cross-seed stability.

## Development

The implementation lives in the `anima_mixer/` package (`nodes.py` is a compatibility shim). Run the test suite with:

```
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

CI (ruff + unittest on Python 3.10/3.12) runs on every push and PR.
